# Turok Objective Markers

These are the source files to my X modification for Turok.

## About:

These files are freely available to both users and developers, but are intended for developer usage.
Users may find some difficulty in using them and are encouraged to instead use the released modification listed below.

Feel free to branch, pull, or open an issue ticket. You are allowed to use my work freely in your modifications. 
Please contact me if you have specific requests or needs related to my work.


## How To Use:

1.  Extract resources as normal, putting the files in their relevent folders (models in models, sounds in sounds, etc)

2.  Merge my main.txt script changes with your Main.txt
    This is simple, just copy and paste into your file. This is important as it loads my scripts into the main game loop.
      `#include "scripts/objectivemarker.txt"`

3.  Open the level editor and open up a level. 
     Place Objective Markers wherever you want. They are listed as Entities Under "objective".

4.  To make them dissappear in a level, run this scripted event.
